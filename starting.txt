
Development environment:
========================
npm run dev
npm run devbase


Final version:
==============
compiles frontend:
npm run buildbase
-- now copy ./dist to the Web server visible location. This needs to be aligned with 
---reverse proxy, e.g. Nginx settings and whatever is provided in package.json
runs backend:
npm run backendbase

===Verification in dev environment===
after moving compiled ./dist, start website with http-server ./
Access with (e.g.): http://192.168.1.2:8080/dist/#/Home

====NOTE=============================================
Example of Nginx settings:
        # pass requests for dynamic content to nodejs/vuejs application
        location /vuevideob/ {
           proxy_pass       http://127.0.0.1:3333/;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;  
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;  
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';  
           proxy_set_header Host $host;  
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;            
           error_log /home/relab_user/NGINX/logs.txt debug;
           client_max_body_size 64M;
        }
        ...
